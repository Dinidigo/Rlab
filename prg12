You are a data analyst tasked with performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on  the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The IPL dataset contains information about  various IPL matches, including match dates, teams, venues, outcomes, and performance  metrics. Your objective is to gain insights into the dataset by conducting an in-depth  analysis using R programming. 
Dataset Description: 
The dataset named "ipl_data.csv" includes the following columns: 
Match_ID: Unique identifier for each match. 
Date: Date of the match. 
Team1: Name of the first team participating in the match. 
Team2: Name of the second team participating in the match. 
Venue: Stadium where the match was played. 
Winner: Name of the winning team. 
Total.Runs: Total runs scored in the match. 
Total.Wickets: Total wickets taken in the match. 
Other relevant columns (if any). 
Problem Tasks: 
Your task is to perform the following Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tasks using R: Task 1: Data Overview and Structure 
Display the structure of the dataset using str() function. 
Output summary statistics of numerical columns using summary(). 
Task 2: Basic Data Insights 
Calculate and display the total number of matches in the dataset. 
Determine the number of unique teams that have participated in IPL matches. List the unique teams from both Team1 and Team2. 
Task 3: Team Performance Analysis 
Calculate the number of matches won by each team and display the results. Compute the average total runs scored in the matches. 
Calculate the average total wickets taken in the matches. 
Task 4: Venue Insights 
Identify and display the most frequently used venue for matches. 
Task 5: Visualization
Create a bar plot to visualize the number of matches won by each team. 
Program:- 
library(readxl) 
library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2)
