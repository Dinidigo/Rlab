Lab Exercise 11: Customer Purchase Analysis 
You are a data analyst at an e-commerce company that sells a variety of products online.  The company has provided you with a dataset containing information about customer  purchases. Your task is to perform a comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into  customer behaviour and spending patterns. 
Dataset Description:  
The dataset customer_purchases.csv contains the following columns: 
• CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer. 
• PurchaseAmount: The amount spent by the customer on a purchase. Problem Tasks: 
You are required to perform the following tasks using R: 
• Task 1: Load the Dataset 
Load the necessary libraries, including readr and dplyr. 
Read the dataset customer_purchases.csv into a data frame named purchase_data. 
• Task 2: Data Summary 
Calculate and display the total number of records in the dataset. 
Calculate and display the total number of unique customers in the dataset. 
• Task 3: Calculate Statistical Measures 
Calculate and display the mean (average) purchase amount. 
Calculate and display the median purchase amount. 
Calculate and display the standard deviation of purchase amounts. 
• Task 4: Customer Segmentation 
Create a new column named Segment in the purchase_data data frame based on the  following criteria: 
"Low Spender" if the purchase amount is less than the median. 
"High Spender" if the purchase amount is greater than or equal to the median. • Task 5: Visualize Data

Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts using the ggplot2  package. Customize the plot with appropriate labels and titles. 
Solution:- 
Packages Need to Installed 
• readr 
• dplyr 
Program:- 
library(readr) 
library(dplyr) 
set.seed(42) 
customer_ids <- 1:100 
# Generating 100 Random numbers from 10 to 200. 
purchase_amounts <- runif(100, min = 10, max = 200) 
dummy_data <- data.frame( 
 Customer_ID = customer_ids, 
 Purchase_Amount = purchase_amounts 
) 
# Writing into a CSV file customer_purchases.csv 
write.csv(dummy_data, "customer_purchases.csv", row.names = FALSE) 
purchase_data <- read_csv("customer_purchases.csv") 
total_records <- nrow(purchase_data) 
total_unique_customers <- n_distinct(purchase_data$Customer_ID) cat("Total number of records:", total_records, "\n") 
cat("Total number of unique customers:", total_unique_customers, "\n") mean_purchase_amount <- mean(purchase_data$Purchase_Amount) median_purchase_amount <- median(purchase_data$Purchase_Amount)
std_dev_purchase_amount <- sd(purchase_data$Purchase_Amount) 
cat("Mean purchase amount:", mean_purchase_amount, "\n") 
cat("Median purchase amount:", median_purchase_amount, "\n") cat("Standard deviation of purchase amounts:", std_dev_purchase_amount,  "\n") 
#Creating a new column called segment. 
purchase_data$Segment <- ifelse(purchase_data$Purchase_Amount <  median_purchase_amount, "Low Spender", "High Spender") 
print(purchase_data) 
hist(purchase_data$Purchase_Amount, main = "Distribution of Purchase Amounts", xlab = "Purchase Amount", col = "blue", border = "black")
