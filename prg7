You are a data analyst working for an e-commerce company that
specializes in selling a variety of products online. The company aims
to analyze customer purchase data comprehensively to gain insights
into customer behaviour and spending patterns.
Your goal is to develop a R program that performs an in-depth
analysis of customer purchase data. You will calculate various
statistical measures and generate visualizations to understand the
distribution of purchase amounts among customers.
Note: Load the necessary libraries, including the dplyr and ggplot2
packages.
Given the example customer purchase data provided below, create a
data frame named purchase_data with two columns: CustomerID and
PurchaseAmount.
Calculate and display the following statistical measures:
• Mean (average) purchase amount
• Median purchase amount
• Standard deviation of purchase amounts
• 1st quartile (25th percentile) of purchase amounts
• 3rd quartile (75th percentile) of purchase amounts
Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts
using the ggplot2 package. Display the histogram with appropriate
labels and titles.

Example Customer Purchase Data:
CustomerID PurchaseAmount
101 150
102 200
103 120
104 300
105 80

Solution:
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Example customer purchase data
purchase_data <- data.frame(
CustomerID = c(101, 102, 103, 104, 105),
PurchaseAmount = c(150, 200, 120, 300, 80)
)

# Calculate statistical measures
mean_purchase <- mean(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
median_purchase <- median(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
sd_purchase <- sd(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount)
q1_purchase <- quantile(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, probs =
0.25)

q3_purchase <- quantile(purchase_data$PurchaseAmount, probs =
0.75)

# Display results
cat("Mean Purchase Amount:", mean_purchase, "\n")
cat("Median Purchase Amount:", median_purchase, "\n")
cat("Standard Deviation of Purchase Amounts:", sd_purchase, "\n")
cat("1st Quartile of Purchase Amounts:", q1_purchase, "\n")
cat("3rd Quartile of Purchase Amounts:", q3_purchase, "\n")

# Create a histogram
ggplot(purchase_data, aes(x = PurchaseAmount)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
labs(title = "Distribution of Purchase Amounts", x = "Purchase
Amount", y = "Frequency")
