Imagine that, you have been tasked with creating a program that
calculates and assigns grades for students enrolled in multiple
courses. The program will take input for the marks obtained by 10
students in 5 different courses, compute the total and average
marks for each student, and assign corresponding grades based on
their average performance.
Declare constants for the number of students (num_students) and
the number of courses (num_courses).
Initialize an empty list to store student information.
For each student:
• Input the student's name.
• Input marks for each of the 5 courses.
• Calculate the total marks and average marks.
• Determine the grade based on the average marks using a
grading scale.
• Display the student information, including their name,
individual course marks, total marks, average marks, and the
assigned grade.

Code in R:
# Constants
num_students <- 10
num_courses <- 5

# Predefined student names
student_names <- c("John", "Anna", "Tim", "Harry", "Pal", "Jim",
"Peter", "Bob", " Cook", "James")

# Predefined course marks for each student
course_marks <- matrix(c(
85, 92, 78, 88, 95, 88, 89, 78,77,81,
75, 80, 85, 70, 60, 90, 67, 70,89,87,
100, 78, 56, 34, 56, 45, 78, 97,66,89,
78, 45, 67, 89, 90, 56, 89, 67,99,98,
89,80,67,78,90, 67, 78,90, 78, 78
), nrow = num_students, byrow = TRUE)

# Initialize a list to store student information
student_records <- list()

# Loop for each student
for (student_index in 1:num_students) {
student_name <- student_names[student_index]

# Initialize variables for calculations
total_marks <- sum(course_marks[student_index, ])
average_marks <- total_marks / num_courses

# Determine grade based on average marks
grade <- ifelse(average_marks >= 90, "A",
ifelse(average_marks >= 80,"B",
ifelse(average_marks >= 70, "C",
ifelse(average_marks >= 60, "D", "F"))))

# Store student information in a record
student_record <- list(name = student_name, marks =
course_marks[student_index, ],
total = total_marks, average = average_marks, grade =
grade)

student_records <- c(student_records, list(student_record))
}

# Display student information
cat("\nStudent Grade Report:\n")
for (student_record in student_records) {
cat("\nName:", student_record$name, "\n")
cat("Marks:", student_record$marks, "\n")
cat("Total Marks:", student_record$total, "\n")
cat("Average Marks:", student_record$average, "\n")
cat("Grade:", student_record$grade, "\n")
}
