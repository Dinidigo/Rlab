You are a data analyst at a retail company that sells products
online. The company is interested in predicting sales for the
upcoming months to better manage inventory and plan
marketing strategies. As part of your role, you need to develop a
program that utilizes time series analysis to forecast sales based
on a historical sales dataset.
Write an R program to forecast sales for the next three months
using time series analysis techniques. The program should
perform the following steps:
• Load the required libraries, including the forecast package.
• Create a data frame with two columns: Month and Sales. The
Month column should contain a sequence of dates from
January 2023 to June 2023 (inclusive), and the Sales column
should contain the corresponding sales amounts (12000,
15000, 18000, 16000, 20000, 22000).
• Convert the sales data into a time series object with a monthly
frequency.
• Fit an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
model to the sales time series using the auto.arima() function.

• Forecast sales for the next three months using the fitted
ARIMA model and the forecast() function.
• Display the forecasted sales results, including point forecasts

Program Code:
# Load required libraries
library(forecast)

# Create a data frame with Month and Sales columns
sales_data <- data.frame(
Month = seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2023-06-01"), by
= "months"),
Sales = c(12000, 15000, 18000, 16000, 20000, 22000)
)

# Convert to time series
sales_ts <- ts(sales_data$Sales, frequency = 12)

# Fit ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(sales_ts)

# Forecast sales for next 3 months
forecast_result <- forecast(arima_model, h = 3)

# Display forecast results
print(forecast_result)
