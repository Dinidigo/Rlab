You are developing a library management system that needs a fine
calculation feature. Write a R program that takes the number of
days a book is overdue and calculates the fine amount based on the
library's policy. The policy states that for the first 7 days, there is
no fine. After 7 days, a fixed fine per day is charged. Additionally,
there's a cap on the fine amount after 30 days.
Input the number of days the book is overdue.
• Use conditional statements to calculate the fine amount based
on the library's policy.
• Display the fine amount along with a message indicating
whether the fine is within the cap or exceeded it.
Program:
# Function to calculate library fine
calculate_fine <- function(days_overdue) {
if (days_overdue <= 7) {
fine <- 0 # No fine for the first 7 days
} else if (days_overdue <= 30) {
fine_per_day <- 2 # Fine per day after 7 days
fine <- (days_overdue - 7) * fine_per_day
} else {
fine_cap <- 50 # Maximum fine after 30 days
fine <- fine_cap
}
return(fine)
}

# Input number of days overdue
days_overdue <- as.integer(readline("Enter the number of days
the book is overdue: "))

# Calculate fine
fine_amount <- calculate_fine(days_overdue)

# Display fine information
cat("Fine Amount:", fine_amount, "\n")
if (fine_amount == 0) {
cat("No fine. Thank you for returning the book on time!\n")
} else {
if (days_overdue > 30) {
cat("Fine exceeds the maximum cap. Please contact the
library.\n")
} else {
cat("Please pay the fine within the specified period.\n")
}
}
